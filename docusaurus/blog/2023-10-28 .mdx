# Blog CI & Indiviaual Byte/Word Indexing work

## Blog CI

Made the `docusaurus` compile in the CI/CD pipeline of github actions and made the `docusaurus` build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. The `gh-pages` branch is used to host the website on github pages.
The website is hosted at [https://sarath191181208.github.io/](https://sarath191181208.github.io/)
Issues faced:

1. The docusaurus build was working, but the blog dates were wrong this is due to the fact that we are using DD-MM-YYYY format in the blog posts and the docusaurus is parsing these dates as UTC+5:30(my local timezone) and converting it into UTC+00:00 This resulted in blogs having 1-day offset errors. This can be fixed by using the YYYY-MM-DD format which the docusaurus treats it as UTC+00:00 format thus not messing up the dates.
2. The github workflow file was having the publish_dir as `./build` it was actually `./docusaurus/build`, we are using working-directory in the yml but it isn't picked up by the action of actions-gh-pages. This was fixed by changing the publish_dir to `./docusaurus/build`

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: ./docusaurus

  ########################
  #### workflow config ###
  ########################

 - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
   with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
# Removed
    - publish_dir: ./build
# Added
    - publish_dir: ./docusaurus/build
```

## Individual Byte/Word Indexing
The syntax like using `w.[]` and `b.[]` are now working. We can use of the fowlling syntax to make the fowlling work.
```asm6502

ORG 100h
.DATA 
  var dw 0x100
CODE:   
  MOV w.[var], 0x10 ; moves 0x0010 -> [var]
  MOV b.[var], 0x10 ; moves 0x10   -> [var]
```
