# 🛠️ Refactor 
🛠️ Refactor conditional check of variable type into the evaluate_ins function And added ByteIndexedAddressing in Assembly8086Tokens

## Refactor conditional check

- Refactored conditional check of variable type into the evaluate_ins function
  The code base was having this type of conditional checks for checking if the variable type is defined as Word (or) as byte
  The fowlling is the example of what I am talking about:

```rust title="./src-tauri/src/compiler/parsers/mov.rs" showLineNumbers
let mov_ins = if is_variable_defined_as_16bit(
    &variable_abs_offset_map,
    get_token_as_label(&high_token),
) {
    0xC7
} else {
    0xC6
};
```

This is a repetative logic and we can mess up quite easily therefore we have refactored this into the evaluate_ins function the following is the example of the same:

```rust title="./src-tauri/src/compiler/parsers/pattern_extractors/utils.rs 181:5" showLineNumbers
let var_type = variable_abs_address_map
    .get(label)
    .unwrap_or(&(VariableType::Word, 0))
    .0;
variable_type = Some(var_type);
```

## Removal of parsing chracter in parse fn and moved it into evaluate ins

The `parse_two_arguments_line` was incharge of handing the substitution of variables and labels into their respective addresses and values. This intrun created a lot of duplicated logic and was getting hard to maintain. Thus, this logic has now been moved into the `evaluate_ins` function which is now incharge of handlig the substitution of variables and labels into their respective addresses and values.

This is what the `parse_two_arguments_line` was doing before: 
```rust  showLineNumbers
match high_token{
    match low_token{ 
        Assembly8086Tokens::Character(label) => {
            let addr_bytes_or_num = get_label_address_or_push_into_ref();
            match addr_bytes_or_num{
                bytes => AddressingMode::RegisterAndAddress
                num => AddressingMode::Registers16bitNumber
            }
        }
    }
}

```

This logic has now been converted into the `evaluate_ins` fn where it is already being done.

## Addition of ByteIndexedAddressing in Assembly8086Tokens

I have recently known that there exists ByteIndexedAddressing in the 8086 processor, it is a mode where you can change/access byte of the memory like when defining the variable as byte. You can also do this in a differnent way therefore to merge all of the uses into a sinlge entity to represent and match easily I have added ByteIndexedAddressing in Assembly8086Tokens. The following is the example of the same:

My discovery: 
```asm6502 showLineNumbers
MOV b.[BX], 0x0A ; moves 0x0A into the byte of the memory pointed by BX
MOV w.[BX], 0x0A ; moves 0x00_0A into the word of the memory pointed by BX
```

As this is the case to represent both `b.[BX]` and `var db` I have added ByteIndexedAddressing in Assembly8086Tokens.

## 📖 DOC:  Setup github actions to automatically deploy docs 

From [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages) docs: 
We have setup a github actions script that looks like this 
```yaml  showLineNumbers
name: Build Docs

defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: ./docusaurus

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - "docusaurus/**"
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - "docusaurus/**"

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: npm 

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./build
            user_name: Sarath19181208[bot]
            user_email: vssarathc04+gh_bot_emu8086@gmail.com
``` 
To make automatically deploy docs to github pages on every push to main branch.
