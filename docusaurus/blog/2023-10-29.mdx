# üõ†Ô∏è Refactor: moved common logic into a pattern

For instruction like `TEST`, `AND`, `MOV`, `ADD` ... etc. All of these follow a single pattern for their compliation step example 

```asm6502
MOV AX, BX ; 0x8B 0xC3 
TEST AX, BX ; 0x85 0xC3 

MOV AX, [BX] ; 0x8B 0x07
TEST AX, [BX] ; 0x85 0x07

MOV AX, [BX+SI] ; 0x8B 0x00
TEST AX, [BX+SI] ; 0x85 0x00

MOV AX, [BX+SI+0x1234] ; 0x8B 0x84 0x34 0x12
TEST AX, [BX+SI+0x1234] ; 0x85 0x84 0x34 0x12
```

Here 0x8B is the root ins (or) in other words MOV and 0xC3 represents the registers. 
All of these instructions fowllow this pattern therefore the logic is sent into a sperate file called `src-tauri\src\compiler\parsers\pattern_extractors\compile_first_ins_reg_pattern.rs` and the functions are as follows 
- `parse_8bitreg_first_addr_mode`
- `parse_16bitreg_first_addr_mode`
