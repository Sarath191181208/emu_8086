# Blog CI & Indiviaual Byte/Word Indexing work

## Blog CI

Made the `docusaurus` compile in the CI/CD pipeline of github actions and made the `docusaurus` build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. The `gh-pages` branch is used to host the website on github pages.
The website is hosted at [https://sarath191181208.github.io/](https://sarath191181208.github.io/)
Issues faced:

1. The docusaurus build was working, but the blog dates were wrong this is due to the fact that we are using DD-MM-YYYY format in the blog posts and the docusaurus is parsing these dates as UTC+5:30(my local timezone) and converting it into UTC+00:00 This resulted in blogs having 1-day offset errors. This can be fixed by using the YYYY-MM-DD format which the docusaurus treats it as UTC+00:00 format thus not messing up the dates.
2. The github workflow file was having the publish_dir as `./build` it was actually `./docusaurus/build`, we are using working-directory in the yml but it isn't picked up by the action of actions-gh-pages. This was fixed by changing the publish_dir to `./docusaurus/build`

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: ./docusaurus

  ########################
  #### workflow config ###

# Added

```

## Individual Byte/Word Indexing

The syntax like using `w.[]` and `b.[]` are now working. We can use of the fowlling syntax to make the fowlling work.

```asm6502

ORG 100h
.DATA
  var dw 0x100
CODE:
  MOV w.[var], 0x10 ; moves 0x0010 -> [var]
  MOV b.[var], 0x10 ; moves 0x10   -> [var]
```

## Compilation of TEST instruction

:::tip What the differnet texts mean in opcode

- `[0x00 0x10]` means that these bytes are derived from memory and address 0x100 is used.
- `u8` means that the byte is derived from the immediate value and has 1byte as size.
- `u16` means that the word is derived from the immediate value and has 2bytes as size.
- `i8` means that the byte is derived from the immediate value is signed and has 1byte size.
- `i16` means that the word is derived from the immediate value is signed and has 2byte size.
- `0x00..0xFF` means that these bytes are derived from the instructions/registers.

- `reg16` means that the register is 16-bit. Ex: `AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`, `SP`, `BP`, `SI`, `DI`
- `reg8` means that the register is 8-bit. Ex: `AL`, `BL`, `CL`, `DL`, `AH`, `BH`, `CH`, `DH`
- `var16` means that the variable is 16-bit. Ex: `var dw 0x100` or `w.[0x100]`
- `var8` means that the variable is 8-bit. Ex: `var db 0x100` or `b.[0x100]`
- `idx16` means that the index is 16-bit. Ex: `w.[BX]` or `w.[SI]` or `w.[DI]`
- `idx8` means that the index is 8-bit. Ex: `b.[BX]` or `b.[SI]` or `b.[DI]`

The `TEST` instruction is now compiled and working. The `TEST` instruction is used to perform bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly. The `TEST` instruction is compiled into the following code.

|          Operand          |           Opcode            | Size(bytes) |                                 Description                                  | Example instruction    |
| :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :---------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ---------------------- |
|       reg16, reg16        |       0x85 0xC0..0xFF       |      2      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST AX, BX`          |
|        reg8, reg8         |       0x84 0xC0..0xFF       |      2      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST AL, BL`          |

|         AL, imm8          |       0xA8 0xC0..0xFF       |      2      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST AL, 0x10`        |
|     reg16, imm16/imm8     |     0xF7 0xC0..0xFF u16     |      4      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST AX, 0x10`        |

| var16/reg16 , reg16/var16 | 0x85 0x06..0x36 [0x02 0x01] |      4      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST [0x100], AX`     |
|   var8/reg8 , reg8/var8   | 0x84 0x06..0x36 [0x02 0x01] |      4      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST [0x100], AL`     |
|     var16, imm16/imm8     |  0xF7 0x06 [0x00 0x10] u16  |      6      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST [0x100], 0x10`   |

|    reg16, idx16+imm16     |     0x85 0x80..0xB0 i16     |      4      | Performs bitwise AND operation on the operands and set the flags accordingly | `TEST AX, [BX+0x1000]` |

## Execution of the test instruction

Made the `TEST` instruction execute and set the flags accordingly. The result isn't stored anywhere, only the flags are chaged.
Algorithm

```rust

// For 16-bit operands
let res = op1 & op2;
carry_flag = false;
overflow_flag = false;
zero_flag = res == 0;
negative_flag = res & 0x8000 != 0;
pairity_flag = res.count_ones() % 2 == 0;

// For 8-bit operands
let res = op1 & op2;
carry_flag = false;
overflow_flag = false;
zero_flag = res == 0;
negative_flag = res & 0x80 != 0;
pairity_flag = res.count_ones() % 2 == 0;

```

## Testing deprecation of functions 
Some of the old functions which don't use best practices are deprecated and the new functions are used. 
The functions which are deprecated are:
- `generate_test` macro
- `generate_test_with_cycles` macro 
- `compile_and_test_str` function

In favour of these convoluted function a new api is created for testing. It is both easy and simple to use. The new api is as follows:
```rust
let code = "MOV AX, BX"
let num_cycles = 1;
run_code(code, num_cycles)
```
