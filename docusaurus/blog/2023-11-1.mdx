# Support for memory, reg addressing for 2 operand instructions

Changes this day :

1. Added support for memory addressing for 2 operand instructions
2. 🐞FIX: `MOV` mem, ax no compiling
3. 🐞FIX: `ADD` ax, mem not compiling
4. ✨ NEW: +compilation of `LEA` ins
5. ✨ NEW: +execution of `LEA` ins

## Support for memory, reg addressing for 2 operand instructions

This is an example instruction

```asm6502 showLineNumbers
    MOV [0x100], Bx ; This was supported
    MOV [BX+SI], AX ; Previously This wasn't supported
```

## 🐞FIX: `MOV` mem, ax no compiling

The `MOV AX, 0x10 + 0x20` kind of instructions weren't being compiled due to the lexer checking the wrong index for the instruction. This has been fixed in the fowlling way.

```rust showLineNumbers
                        &low_token => address_bytes.to_vec()
                    )
                );
                // Removed
                Ok(i + 3)
                // Added
                Ok(tokenized_line.len())
            }
        },
        // MOV AX..DI, var
```

## 🐞FIX: `ADD` ax, mem not compiling

The `ADD AX, [0x100]` kind of instructions weren't being compiled due to the lexer checking the wrong index for the instruction. This has been fixed in the fowlling way.

```rust showLineNumbers
                        &low_token => address_bytes.to_vec()
                    )
                );
                // Removed
                Ok(i + 3)
                // Added
                Ok(tokenized_line.len())
            }
        },
        // ADD AX..DI, var
```

## ✨ NEW: +compilation of `LEA` ins

The `LEA` instruction is used to load the effective address of the source operand into the destination operand. This instruction is used to put the offset address of the source operand in the destination operand. The destination operand is always a register, and the source operand is always a memory operand. The source operand specifies the address of the data. The LEA instruction is useful for accessing table data and executing table lookup operations.

```asm6502 showLineNumbers
    LEA AX, [0x100] ; AX = 0x100
    LEA AX, [BX+SI] ; AX = BX + SI
    LEA AX, [BX+SI+0x100] ; AX = BX + SI + 0x100
    LEA AX, [BX+SI+0x100+0x200] ; AX = BX + SI + 0x100 + 0x200
```

## ✨ NEW: +execution of `LEA` ins

The algorithm for the execution of the `LEA` instruction is as follows:

1. Fetch the instruction.
2. Decode the instruction to determine the addressing mode of the source operand.
3. Calculate the effective address of the source operand.
4. Load the effective address into the destination register.
5. Store the result in the destination register.

## ✨ NEW: +compilation of `LES` ins

The `LES` instruction is used to load double word register pair with a far pointer. The `LES` instruction is used to load the segment register and the offset into the destination register pair. The destination operand is always a register, and the source operand is always a memory operand. The source operand specifies the address of the data. The `LES` instruction is useful for accessing table data and executing table lookup operations.

```asm6502 showLineNumbers
    LES AX, [0x100] ; AX = [0x100], ES = [0x102]
    LES AX, [BX+SI] ; AX = [BX + SI], ES = [BX + SI + 0x2]
    LES AX, [BX+SI+0x100] ; AX = [BX + SI + 0x100 ] , ES = [BX + SI + 0x102]
    LES AX, [BX+SI+0x100+0x200] ; AX = [BX + SI + 0x100 + 0x200], ES = [BX + SI + 0x302]
```

## ✨ NEW: +execution of `LES` ins

The algorithm for the execution of the `LES` instruction is as follows:

1. Fetch the instruction.
2. Decode the instruction to determine the addressing mode of the source operand.
3. Calculate the effective address of the source operand.
4. Load the effective address into the destination register.
5. Store the result in the destination register.
6. Load the effective address + 2 into the extra segment register.

## Compilation of `OR` ins

It is used to perform bitwise or operation on the operands the result is stored in the first operand.

<GenerateCompilationTable 
        instructionName="OR"
        reg_16bit_and_anything_ins= {0x0B}
        reg_8bit_and_anything_ins= {0x0A}
        indexed_addressing_and_anyting_ins= {0x09}
        addr_and_8bit_reg= {0x08}
        al_and_num_ins= {0x0C}
        ax_and_num_ins= {0x0D}
        reg16bit_and_16bit_num= {0x81}
        reg16bit_and_8bit_num= {0x83}
        reg8bit_and_num= {0x80}
        reg_num_sub_ins= {0xC8}
        addr16bit_and_16bit_num= {0x81}
        addr16bit_and_8bit_num= {0x83}
        addr8bit_and_num= {0x80}
        addr_num_sub_ins= {0x0E}
/>
