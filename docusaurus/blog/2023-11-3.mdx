# Support for of `SBB` ins

## Compilation of `SBB` ins

It is used to subtract the second operand from the first operand along with the borrow flag. The result is stored in the first operand. The flags are modified accordingly. The operands may be registers or memory locations. The first operand is also called the destination operand and the second operand is called the source operand. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, register, or memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the destination operand format.

```asm6502 showLineNumbers
SBB AX, BX
```

## 🛠️ Refactor: extracted common consume logic in cpu

```rust showLineNumbers
// Removed
match ins {
    // Removed
    0x06 | 0x0E | 0x16 | 0x1E | 0x26 | 0x2E | 0x36 | 0x3E => {
    // Removed
        // ...
    // Removed
    }
    // Removed
    0x00..=0x3F => {
    // Removed
        // ...
    // Removed
    }
    // Removed
    0x40..=0x7F => {
    // Removed
        // ...
    // Removed
    }
    // Removed
    0x80..=0xBF => {
    // Removed
        // ...
    // Removed
    }
// Removed
}

// replaced with
// Added
match self.consume_bytes_and_parse_double_ins(mem) {
    // Added
    AddressingMode::Address(reg_idx, addr) => {
        // Added
        // ...  
    // Added
    }
    // Added
    AddressingMode::Reg(reg_idx, low_reg) => {
        // Added
        // ...
    // Added
    }
// Added
}
```

##  ✨ NEW: Support xchg instruction

Made the `xchg` instruction work with all the addressing modes.
