# 🛠️ Refactor of common parsing while exec of reg as first ins
The logic of register as first instruction is always similar for example 
`TEST AX, BX` -> bytes [ 0x85, 0xD8 ], `ADD AX, BX` -> bytes [ 0x01, 0xD8 ] and so on.
while exec 0xD8 is always the register for instructions. Therefore, the logic of parsing the register is common for all the instructions. So, I have refactored the code to make it more readable and maintainable.
The new functions are 
- `consume_bytes_and_parse_8bit_reg_as_first_arg_double_ins`
- `consume_bytes_and_parse_16bit_reg_as_first_arg_double_ins`

The functions are used in the fowlling ways 
```rust showLineNumbers
// For 16bit registers
self.consume_bytes_and_parse_16bit_reg_as_first_arg_double_ins(
    mem,
    &|cpu: &mut CPU, val1: u16, val2: u16| -> Option<u16> {
        let res = val1 & val2;
        cpu.set_test_ins_flags_from_16bit_res(res);
        None
    },
)

// For 8bit registers
let exec_fn = &|cpu: &mut CPU, val1: u8, val2: u8| -> Option<u8> {
    let res = val1 & val2;
    cpu.set_test_ins_flags_from_8bit_res(res);
    None
};
self.consume_bytes_and_parse_8bit_reg_as_first_arg_double_ins(mem, exec_fn);
```
