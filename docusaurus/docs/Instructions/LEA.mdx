## Attributes

| Attribute    | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operands** | The first operand is the destination register. The second operand is the source operand. operand1: Register, operand2: Memory         |
| **Size**     | Word                                                                                                                                  |
| **Action**   | Performs a memory indirect addressing operation. The effective address of the source operand is loaded into the destination register. |
| **Flags**    | None                                                                                                                                  |

:::info INFO
For instructions such as `LEA AX, [0x100]` (or) `LEA SP, Var` the assembler will convert the instruction to `MOV AX, 0x100` (or) `MOV SP, Var` respectively.
This is because the `MOV` instruction is much more efficient than the `LEA` instruction.
