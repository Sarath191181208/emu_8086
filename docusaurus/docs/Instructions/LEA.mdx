## Attributes

| Attribute    | Description                                                                                                                           |

| **Operands** | The first operand is the destination register. The second operand is the source operand. operand1: Register, operand2: Memory         |
| **Size**     | Word                                                                                                                                  |
| **Action**   | Performs a memory indirect addressing operation. The effective address of the source operand is loaded into the destination register. |
| **Flags**    | None                                                                                                                                  |
