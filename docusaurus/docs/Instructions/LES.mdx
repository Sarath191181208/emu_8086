## Attributes

| Attribute     | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operands**  | The destination operand is a general-purpose register. The source operand is a memory location.                                     |
| **Operation** | `DEST ← SRC; ES ← SRC+2`                                                                                                            |
| **Size**      | 2 (to) 6 bytes                                                                                                                      |
| **Action**    | Performs Memory Indirect Read and puts the value in the memory location into the destination register. Loads ES with the next word. |
| **Flags**     | None                                                                                                                                |

## Explanation 

```asm6502 showLineNumbers
MOV [BX]     , 0x1234
MOV [BX+0x02], 0x5678
LES AX, [BX] ; AX = 0x1234, ES = 0x5678
``` 
Here the value at the memory location `0x1234` is loaded into the `AX` register and the value at the memory location `0x1236` is loaded into the `ES` register.
i.e the values of the registers are as follows : 
```
AX = 0x1234
ES = 0x5678
```
