## Attributes

| Attribute     | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operands**  | The first operand is a general purpose register or a memory location. The second operand is a general purpose register or a memory location. |
| **Operation** | `operand1, operand2 = operand2, operand1`                                                                                                    |
| **Action**    | The contents of the first operand are exchanged with the contents of the second operand.                                                     |
| **Size**      | 2 to 6 Bytes                                                                                                                                 |
| **Flags**     | No flags are affected.                                                                                                                       |

## Example 
```asm6502 showLineNumbers
MOV AX, 0x10; This is the hex number 10 = 16 in decimal
MOV BX, 10O ; This is the ocatal number 10  = 8 in decimal
XCHG AX, BX ; Exchange the contents of AX and BX
```

> The contents of AX are now changed with the contents of BX. <br/>
> AX now contains 8 and BX now contains 16.
