## Attributes

| Attribute     | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operands**  | The first operand is an general purpose register or a memory location. The second operand is a general-purpose register, memory location, or immediate value. |
| **Operation** | `operand1 = operand1 OR operand2`                                                                                                                             |
| **Size**      | 2 to 6 bytes.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Action**    | Performs a logical OR of the first operand with the second operand and stores the result in the first operand.                                                |
| **Flags**     | <FlagsChangedTable carryFlag={false} overflowFlag={false} zeroFlag="changed" signFlag="changed" parityFlag="changed" auxiliaryCarryFlag="changed" />                                       |

## Example 
```asm6502 showLineNumbers
MOV AX, 0x0001
OR AX, 0x0002
```
> Here the value of `AX` is `0x0003` after the `OR` instruction is executed. <br/>
> This is because 0x0001 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0001 and 0x0002 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0010. <br/>
> The `OR` operation is performed on each bit of the operands.<br/>
> The result is 0b0000_0000_0000_0011 which is 0x0003.
